# üåè Cultural AI Tutor ‚Äî AI-Powered Storytelling for Children

> **Empowering the next generation to learn math, science, and history through culturally rich, AI-generated stories.**

---

## üöÄ Why This Project Stands Out

Cultural AI Tutor is not just another educational app‚Äîit's a full-stack, production-grade, AI-powered learning platform designed for children. It blends cutting-edge AI (Google Gemini), real-time databases (Supabase), and ultra-modern web tech (Vite, React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS) to deliver:

- **Personalized, culturally relevant stories** for any subject or topic
- **Ultra-natural voice narration** with perfect pauses and pitch modulation
- **Interactive learning** with MCQs, reflection questions, and instant AI feedback
- **Progress tracking, achievements, and streaks**
- **Beautiful, accessible, and mobile-first UI**

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Architect and deliver complex, scalable, and delightful user experiences
- Integrate multiple APIs and cloud services securely
- Build for accessibility, performance, and real-world impact
- Ship features that are both technically advanced and deeply empathetic to users
